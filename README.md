I'm not serious making this distro, I make them just for fun.

Why I gave it a name is just to beautify the iso file, there is no philosophy in it, the brand was inspired by my last name, and I made it during the celebration of Eid Fitri, a celebration in Islamic culture, that's why the brand idea was inspired.


the window manager is bspwm. if you wanna try, open terminal with super + enter and open rofi launcher with super + shift + enter. 
And if you want to install type sudo(or doas) calamares. after succesfull installed reboot your system and type in terminal again rub_the_magic_lamp for installed yay and change neofetch config and if you dont want dual boot, type set_genie_free in terminal for grub configuration. i know its dramatic echo but have fun with my distro :D
